# Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

This repository is part of the Udacity Nanodegree program and focuses on predicting bike sharing patterns using neural networks.

## Overview
- **Bike-Sharing-Dataset**: Dataset used for training and testing the neural network.
- **Your_first_neural_network.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of a neural network for predicting bike sharing patterns.

## How to Use
This project, created three years ago as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program, demonstrates the implementation of a neural network for predicting bike sharing patterns. To explore the code and run the experiments, open the Jupyter Notebook named "Your_first_neural_network.ipynb" and execute the cells sequentially.

Please note that this repository was last updated three years ago as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program. The provided materials offer valuable insights into building and training a neural network for bike sharing prediction.
